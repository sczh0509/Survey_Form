This is the second web development project of the FreeCodeCamp Responsive Web Design course. This particular projects requires a survey form to be built with pure HTML and CSS. 

**Things that I have learned
- can use transform to easily scale form elements such as radio buttons and checkboxes
- minwidth and maxwidth can be used to control the size of a textarea
- margin: auto to center divs
